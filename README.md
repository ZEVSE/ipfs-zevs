Our goal is to **create visual and interaction standards and patterns for working with IPFS that are ...**

- **Simple**: Present the big ideas of IPFS clearly, without unnecessary complexity
- **Accessible**: Enable *everyone* to take advantage of what IPFS offers
- **Reusable**: Offer compelling standards and atomic patterns to the community of IPFS builders
- **Beautiful**: By their nature, things that are simple, accessible and reusable are also beautiful

## IPFS GUI projects

### Primary projects

Our primary focus is on the three Protocol Labs-led "helper" apps that provide a GUI for IPFS as a whole. Our aim is to make them useful for seasoned IPFS developers while also offering a welcoming introduction to IPFS for those less experienced.

For a more comprehensive overview of the resources that come together to build, support, and provide education around Web UI, Desktop, and Companion, please see the [IPFS GUI Family Mental Model](https://ipfs-gui-mental-model.netlify.app/) and our [June 2020 user research report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V5sDSxMqhhplpcB8u8CffiGWHUvw-t4p_sn5vigdR90/edit#).

### All projects

In addition to the apps above, the IPFS GUI group supports work on issues in all of the following repos. You can get a birds-eye view on prioritization and progress of GUI-centric work in these repos in [our ZenHub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/-ipfs-app-family-ux-5e7a3123e969e659cdebb5e6/board?repos=111841602,32695583,36580101,24483721,142161410,119716282,116711586,38799513,142181521,147528357,148369983,40225364,104770273). *Note that our focus is primarily on UX-related work, so not all issues within all these repos may be in our group's purview.*

## Q3 2020 update

### Now half of the Web Browsers & GUI Working Group!

After a Q2 of [research](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V5sDSxMqhhplpcB8u8CffiGWHUvw-t4p_sn5vigdR90/edit#) and [analysis](https://ipfs-gui-mental-model.netlify.app/) — as well as seeing the concrete gains provided by GUI-based work on IPFS — the IPFS core team has re-activated the **Web Browsers & GUI Working Group** as a combined team of this group and the [IPFS in-web-browsers group](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers). This larger working group operates with a focus on furthering browser adoption and integration, as well as improving the functionality and usability of our GUI-based tools as a whole, with a particular focus on benefiting the onboarding of new IPFS developers and users.

## Get involved!

### Join a meeting

We'd love to meet you in person at one of our open Web Browsers & GUI Working Group meetings. They're a great way to get quickly up to speed on our work, including latest developments and awesome demos.

- **When:** Every other Tuesday at 16:30 UTC (check the [IPFS Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ipfs.io_eal36ugu5e75s207gfjcu0ae84@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC) to see exact dates!)
- **Where:** https://protocol.zoom.us/j/833247793
- **Agenda**: https://hackmd.io/QaxiCU8BQqOuK8B8Tdi36g

You can also explore [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuhRWgmPaHtRIXVTy_ngBwvsXvWw10mR8) and [notes](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/tree/master/meeting-notes) from past meetings any time.

### Contribute to an issue

Contributions to our work are more than welcome! The easiest way to see what issues are prioritized and on deck across the GUI space is to use our [unified public ZenHub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/-ipfs-app-family-ux-5e7a3123e969e659cdebb5e6/board?repos=111841602,32695583,36580101,24483721,142161410,119716282,116711586,38799513,142181521,147528357,148369983,40225364,104770273); our work hits a lot of repos, so having them in one place offers a good birds-eye view.

If you don't want to use ZenHub, that's cool too. Each of the repos listed under ["All projects"](#all-projects) above makes use of the IPFS Project's [global issue labeling scheme](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/ISSUE_LABELS.md). Good labels to look for are ...
- `help wanted`
- `good first issue`
- and there are even occasional `bounty` labels for issues with rewards as part of the [IPFS Bounty Board](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/projects/1)!

If you see an issue that catches your eye, leave a comment so we know you're interested, and we'll go from there!

We're an open project and a friendly group, so please be nice and **read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_JS.md)** when you're ready to jump in.

### Discuss in GitHub or IRC

We do hang out on IRC — see the [#ipfs](https://www.irccloud.com/invite?channel=%23ipfs&amp;hostname=irc.freenode.net&amp;port=6697&amp;ssl=1") and [#ipfs-gui](https://www.irccloud.com/invite?channel=%23ipfs-gui&amp;hostname=irc.freenode.net&amp;port=6697&amp;ssl=1") channels on irc.freenode.net — but for the sake of async communication, archiving, and searchability, we encourage discussions to happen in the context of GitHub issue comments whenever practical.
